## Here are the test cases for the `_log_test_coverage_path` method in the `CommonLoggingStatements` class:

from unittest.mock import MagicMock

## ```python

    # Act
    result = instance._log_test_coverage_path(test_coverage_path)

    # Assert
    assert result is None  # Since the method does not return anything, we just check if it runs without errors
