# Analysis of the Function:
# The function `get_imported_libraries` is a simple getter method that returns the set of imported libraries stored in an instance variable called `imported_libraries`. This method does not take any parameters and directly accesses the instance attribute to return its value. There are no complex operations or dependencies, making it straightforward to test.
