# Analysis of the function:
# The function logs a message if it fails to generate correct code with 100% coverage after a certain number of retries.
# It uses print for logging, which is synchronous and not ideal in an async context. However, since this is explicitly stated as a non-async coroutine, we'll proceed accordingly.
